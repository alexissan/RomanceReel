# RomanceReel
A beautifully designed custom carousel for profiles, implemented entirely in SwiftUI. This carousel features smooth custom animations, including a unique rotation effect and interactive, animated buttons, offering a polished and engaging user experience. Perfect for showcasing profile cards in your iOS apps with modern SwiftUI techniques

# Notes
The project is just a simple demo project that I have created following some examples I found online in https://dribbble.com/shots/20551874-Dating-Mobile-IOS-App (kudos to the designer author of the animation as I found it very nice and smooth).
Anyone interested in improving my project feel free to open a PR and I will gladly review it!
